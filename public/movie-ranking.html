    <p> I Am Legend" is a 2007 post-apocalyptic science fiction thriller film starring Will Smith. Set in a 
        near-future New York City, the story follows Dr. Robert Neville, a brilliant scientist who is seemingly 
        the last human survivor after a man-made plague has wiped out most of humanity. The virus has turned 
        the majority of the population into nocturnal mutants called Darkseekers, who are highly aggressive and 
        sensitive to UV light.</p>
    <p> Neville, immune to the virus, spends his days roaming the deserted city, scavenging for supplies, 
        and attempting to find a cure using his own blood. He lives with his loyal dog, Sam, who provides 
        companionship in the otherwise desolate environment. At night, Neville barricades himself in his 
        fortified home to stay safe from the Darkseekers.</p>    
    <p> As the film progresses, Neville discovers signs of other survivors and must navigate the psychological 
        toll of isolation, the constant threat of the Darkseekers, and his hope to save humanity. The movie is a 
        gripping exploration of survival, the human spirit, and the consequences of scientific experimentation 
        gone awry.</p>  
    <p> The film's haunting visuals of an empty New York City and Smith's powerful performance make "I Am Legend" 
        a memorable and thought-provoking cinematic experience.</p>
